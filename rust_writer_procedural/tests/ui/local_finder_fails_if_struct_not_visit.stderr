  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
  = note: the following trait defines an item `visit_file`, perhaps you need to implement it:
          candidate #1: `Visit`
  = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `local_finder` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
